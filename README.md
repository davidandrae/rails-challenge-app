# JustRelate Mini-Code-Challenge Ruby on Rails
## Questions:
  1. Do you see any issues with the presented feature?
  2. How would you address them?

## Your Task:
 - Build an API endpoint '/api/image_slides' that returns all __active__ slides __with an odd ID__.
 - Create a separate API Controller for this endpoint; it should only respond to a GET request.
 - The response should be a JSON containing only the relevant elements.
